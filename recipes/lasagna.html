    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish made of layers of pasta, rich meat or vegetable sauce, melted cheese, 
        and creamy mozzarella. The layers are baked together until golden and bubbly, creating a hearty and comforting meal.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>3/4 pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li>1 pound sweet Italian sausage</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>1/2 cup minced onion</li>
        <li>1 can crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 cans tomato sauce</li>
        <li>2 cans tomato paste</li>
        <li>1/2 cup water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons dried basil leaves</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon grounded black pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon fennel seeds</li>
        <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>3/4 cup grated parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>3/4 pound sliced mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>16 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Gather all your ingredients.</li>
        <li>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned.</li>
        <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, 
            basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 ½ hours,
             stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes.
             Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>To assemble, spread 1 ½ cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise
             over meat sauce, overlapping slightly. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the 
             mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 ½ cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either 
            spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
